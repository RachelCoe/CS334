Design a two table customer contact database that would store at least the following data items:

CUSTOMER table:

customerID
last name
first name
street address 1
street address 2
city
state
postal code
country
email address
home phone
facebook page url
cell phone
userid
password
salespersonID (salesperson who the customer deals with)
SALESPERSON table:

salespersonID
last name
first name
street address 1
street address 2
city
state
postal code
country
email address
home phone
facebook page url
cell phone
 

Using SQL (try using the phpMyAdmin interface, rather than the command line interface, but be sure to type in your SQL regardless), write code to create and populate the database with at least 10 rows of data in the customer table, and 4 rows of data in the salesperson table.

Perform at least 3 distinct queries of your database and display results based on those queries:

Query#1: get data from the Customer table;

Query #2: get data from the Salesperson table;

Query #3: produce a listing of all the customers each salesperson has - the output should display salesperson last name, salesperson first name, customer last name, and customer first name. (For this query you will have to join the tables).

Your grade will be assessed based upon your utilization of SQL.
