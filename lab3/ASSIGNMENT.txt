To get started with PHP, and prepare for future assignments:


1. download and install XAMPP to either your local machine or a USB drive. (that is, if you want to have a "local" server to play with)
2. obtain an account on a third party web host (like infinityfree or 000webhosting or x10hosting.com, etc.)
3. create the "Tip of the Day" program, (feel free to use external CSS for the various colors and styles.  Details/instructions for the lab requirement can be viewed at:  lab3_instructions_book_page19.pdfPreview the document

 Note: some of the code at the top of that sample is from XHTML standards, which are no longer used - so follow the basic template that is used for HTML5.


4. save a version of your code as a .txt file, and then place a line of html code near the top of the page with a hyperlink to the text file, so that I can review all your php code. (for an example see: http://pld7fall2014.x10.mx/tip.php (Links to an external site.)  and http://petecs334.epizy.com/lab2/formtestsample.php (Links to an external site.) - do NOT worry about the content below the quote - it's presented here just as an introduction to content we'll go over next week)


5. upload all the files created for "Tip of the Day" to your remote host, and submit the URL below so I can review your coding and output.
