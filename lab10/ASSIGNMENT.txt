For this lab, you are to utilize your XHTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL skills....

Building on what you did in Lab 9, write a program to:

VIEW data in your customer list
ADD data to your customer table
EDIT data in your customer table
SEARCH for data: you can use the same php file, or a new file to SEARCH for data in your customer table; ask for a user's name and searches the database for that user, and returns the results for that user. 
 

Submit the URL for your working code, the text file of the working code, and any SQL code that you employed to do this lab.

Your lab grade will be based on your displayed mastery of HMTL, CSS, PHP, and SQL.
