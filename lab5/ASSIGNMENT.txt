For this lab, write code for the following scenario:

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 (increment by 1); but for multiples of four, print "Hail To" instead of the number, and for multiples of six, print " Pitt".  For numbers which are multiples of both four and six, print "Hail To Pitt".

Assume that you'll be working with integers only.

Don't forget - place your name somewhere in the head or body area of your code; and place a link to a text version of your php code.

Also...remember...only post the URL to your finished php file that's been uploaded to an 3rd party host.
